# The Odin Project Recipe Page
This is a basic HTML project showcasing a recipe webpage for three delicious dishes. Each recipe includes a short description, ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, and images for a visual appeal.
## Motivation
The primary goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with HTML fundamentals, particularly focusing on how to use anchor tags (`<a>`) for linking and image tags (`<img>`) for embedding visuals.
